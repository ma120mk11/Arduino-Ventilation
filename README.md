# Arduino-Ventilation

Ventilation automation for Summer Cottage. 
The point of this project is to dry the interior of the summer cottage in spring and summer to avoid mold.

There is also a system for direct air for use in the summer, to cool the inside of the building. 

The air is passed trough a custom made "solar panel" that heats up the air.

- Room

Other features:
- Nextion Touch Display inside the building for control and monitoring.
