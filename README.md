# Arduino-Ventilation

Ventilation automation for Summer Cottage. 
The point of this project is to dry the interior of the summer cottage in spring and summer to avoid mold and improve the air quality inside.

There is also a system for direct air for use in the summer, to cool the inside of the building. 

The air is passed trough a custom made "solar panel" that heats up the air. 
The panel is made of aluminium pipes, painted black to absorb heat.

Temperature sensors is located:
- Outside
- Inside of "solar panel"
- Heated air 
- Room

Other features:
- Nextion Touch Display inside the building for control and monitoring.
- Sensor data is collected and sent to ThingsPeak for realtime data visualization.
- Logs sensor data on an SD-Card
- The whole system is completely off the grid
